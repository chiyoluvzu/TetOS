# TetOS: FOSS macOS for Intel (Post-Tahoe Era)

**TetOS** is a free and open-source operating system designed to continue the legacy of macOS on Intel hardware after Apple’s shift to Apple Silicon and the deprecation of Intel support. Inspired by the aesthetics, UX, and UNIX underpinnings of macOS, TetOS aims to recreate a familiar environment for users who still rely on x86_64 systems, particularly in the post-Tahoe (macOS 14) era.

## Key Goals

- Preserve the macOS user experience and design language for Intel hardware
- Rebuild key components (Darwin, Quartz, Cocoa-like frameworks) as free software
- Maintain compatibility with legacy Mac software where possible
- Offer a customizable and lightweight desktop environment
- Focus on performance, stability, and privacy over bloated cloud features

## Why TetOS is Justifiable

- **Hardware Reclamation**: Millions of Intel Macs are still powerful and usable. TetOS prevents forced obsolescence by offering a modern OS for them.
- **Right to Modify**: Under first-sale doctrine, users should be free to repurpose their hardware—even if it means recreating parts of the software experience.
- **FOSS Principles**: TetOS embraces transparency, auditability, and community ownership in contrast to Apple’s locked-down ecosystem.
- **Security Through Ownership**: Instead of relying on opaque SEP hardware or vendor policy, TetOS empowers users to understand and secure their machines on their terms.
- **Digital Longevity**: As macOS fragments across ARM and Intel, TetOS provides a consistent platform for users and developers who refuse to discard functional devices.
