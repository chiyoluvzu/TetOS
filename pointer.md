# Apple Silicon CPU & Hardware Internals

- **Apple M1/M2 Microarchitecture**  
  The Apple M-series “Firestorm” CPU core is a wide (8-issue) ARM64e OoO pipeline. Dougall Johnson’s public analysis shows Firestorm’s multiple dispatch queues, schedulers, and execution ports (ALUs, loads, stores, FP/SIMD) that allow up to 8 micro-ops per cycle. ARM architecture manuals (ARMv8/ARMv9 reference) and community guides (e.g., Siguza’s ARM Bootcamp) are invaluable for understanding Apple’s extensions (PAC, etc.). Dougall’s blog also details instruction fusion and latencies on M1 (see his “Firestorm” pipeline diagram).

- **Apple Silicon Subsystems**  
  The Asahi Linux documentation provides an _Introduction to Apple Silicon_ covering the SoC subsystems (CPU, GPU, NPU, interconnect, I/O) and a _Platform Security Crash Course_ that explains the Secure Enclave (SEP) and boot policies. Asahi notes that the SEP holds a Boot Policy enrolling a signed kernelcache hash and a sealed APFS snapshot hash. Apple’s own _Platform Security Guide_ (2023) outlines hardware-based features (SEP, cryptographic engines, secure boot) and OS protections (Pointer Auth, KIP, etc.).

- **ARM Security Features**  
  Apple Silicon includes ARM64e Pointer Authentication (PAC) and other mitigations. Public analyses document these—most notably, the 2022 “PACMAN” attack used speculative execution side-channels to break M1’s PAC. Other ARM features (PAN, APRR, etc.) are covered in community blogs. General ARM ARM references and ARM developer resources (listed on `hack-different/apple-knowledge`) are useful baselines for Apple’s extensions.

# macOS Boot Process & Platform Security

- **Secure Boot Stages**  
  Apple Silicon Macs boot via multiple signed stages: SecureROM → LLB → iBoot → kernelcache (from APFS System Volume). The SEP enforces a Boot Policy per APFS container, containing the Apple-signed hash of the kernelcache and the sealed system volume. If verification fails, the SEP halts boot.

- **APFS Boot Volume Layout**  
  Oakley’s _macOS 13 Boot Disk Structure_ diagram explains the APFS layout: iSCPreboot (LocalPolicy files), Recovery, and Volume Group (System/Data/VM). In Full Security mode, the SEP requires the booted kernelcache to match the signed SSV.

- **LocalPolicy & Recovery**  
  LocalPolicy files stored in iSCPreboot encode secure boot settings (e.g., SIP status). `bputil` can be used to dump these. Example: `sudo bputil -d`. Apple ships with Full Security by default (SIP=on, no unsigned kexts), configurable via Startup Security Utility.

- **Bootloaders & PongoOS**  
  Asahi’s `m1n1` is an open-source bootloader used for custom kernels. Corellium’s PongoOS (built on checkra1n) includes Kernel PatchFinder (KPF) for SEP exploitation. Tools like `kmutil`, `nvram`, `csrutil` support Apple Silicon RE workflows.

# Darwin Kernel & System Internals

- **XNU Source Code**  
  XNU (Mach + BSD/IOKit) is open source and ARM64-capable. Found in `apple-oss-distributions/xnu`. Useful for inspecting syscalls, IOKit classes, and kernel structures.

- **Kernel Collections (kexts)**  
  macOS Big Sur+ uses Boot Kext Collections. `kmutil` creates arm64e kext collections. These can be extracted and disassembled (e.g., Ghidra with patched Mach-O headers).

- **AMFI & Kext Signing**  
  AMFI enforces code signing. Blogs like ExceptionLevelOne dissect its use of the MAC framework and hooks like `mpo_proc_check_get_task`.

- **System Integrity Protection (SIP)**  
  SIP prevents root-level system modifications. On Apple Silicon, SIP is read from device tree (`lp-sip0`). Resources like Mykola Grymalyuk’s blog document CSR flags and bypasses.

- **Dyld Shared Cache & SSV**  
  System libraries are stored in dyld shared cache, inside APFS Preboot “Cryptex” (Ventura+). Dumping libraries now requires extracting from this container. SSV hashing protects the OS snapshot.

- **Kernel Security Features**  
  Apple Silicon includes hardware features (PAC, KTRR) and XNU protections like Kernel Integrity Protection (KIP). Research from Microsoft (“Shrootless,” “Bridger”) shows how system_installd and other entitled processes can bypass kext signing.

# Tools & Techniques for Reverse Engineering

- **Disassemblers & Decompilers**  
  IDA Pro, Ghidra, Binary Ninja, Hopper, radare2/Cutter are used. Ghidra requires Mach-O workarounds. Many GitHub plugins/scripts help parse Apple’s stripped binaries.

- **Mach-O Utilities**  
  Apple tools: `otool`, `lipo`, `codesign`, `kmutil`. Third-party: `dyld_extract`, `dsc_extractor`, `dyld_shared_cache_util`, `img4tool`. Libraries and wikis like iOSRE and Apple-knowledge assist with trustcache and Mach-O analysis.

- **Bootloader & Firmware**  
  `m1n1` (Asahi) can load kernels. PongoOS provides a shell to run pre-boot code. Older tools like `pyim4p` extract IMG4/DTBs. LLDB and custom scripts allow remote kernel debugging.

- **Kernel Patching & Debug**  
  Live debugging techniques include LLDB with Ethernet, memory patching, or kernel extension hooking (e.g., Lilu, Substitute). Fuzzing tools like KextFuzz (USENIX 2023) and Syzkaller/AFL variants are used for IOKit driver testing.

# Notable Vulnerabilities & Research

- **GoFetch (Prefetcher Side-Channel)**  
  2023 research uncovered an M1/M2/M3 flaw leaking AES keys via the prefetcher. It is unpatchable in software.

- **PACMAN (Pointer Auth Attack)**  
  ISCA 2022 paper showed how to brute-force PAC codes via speculative side channels on M1. Turns minor bugs into root-level compromise.

- **Secure Enclave Exploits**  
  Checkm8 targeted A10–A11 SEP BootROM. Tools like PongoOS KPF help automate SEP memory exploits. No known hardware root exploit exists yet for M1+.

- **Kernel & Kext Vulnerabilities**  
  Microsoft’s Shrootless and Bridger research showed bypasses for SIP using entitlements. Academic research like KextFuzz discovered CVEs via fuzzing closed-source kexts.

# Community & Documentation Resources

- **Asahi Linux Docs**  
  Asahi’s wiki includes Apple Silicon Subsystems, Platform Security, and bootloader internals. Feature status pages show SoC support and quirks.

- **Books & Papers**  
  _Mac OS X Internals_ (Amit Singh) and _macOS/iOS Internals_ (Jonathan Levin) are foundational. Conference papers (USENIX, IEEE) offer cutting-edge research: PACMAN, GoFetch, KextFuzz.

  Jailbreak toolchains (checkra1n, unc0ver, Odyssey), PongoOS/KPF, and open-source bootloaders offer insight. GitHub is full of helpful utilities—Mach-O parsers, hypervisor tools, dumper scripts. Mailing lists and bug trackers can surface new details.
